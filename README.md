# Kae's dotfiles

Personal dotfiles mainly for neovim, kitty, zsh, neofetch and hyprland

Take what you want, leave what you don't.

I'm fairly new to the linux ecosystem so expect things to not work properly.

## NeoVim

Configured to my current tastes with help from other dotfiles, this will most likely change as I code more
#### Shoutout to [ecosse3](https://github.com/ecosse3) and his great EcoVim setup which I heavily borrowed from - [EcoVim (github)](https://github.com/ecosse3/nvim)
